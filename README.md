### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So about me: I'm a 24 year old, recently graduated from Stony Brook University in May 2023 with a degree in Psychology. I worked for 2 research labs during my undergraduate years. One lab was on-campus and worked with neuro-imaging techniques like EEG and fMRI. The other lab worked closely 
with our participants to develop a new method of classification for psychiatric disorders. My day-to-day work in these labs ranged from contacting individuals about our study, data processing for raw EEG data, data entry about participant info, and working a lot of in-lab visits with participants. I enjoyed this work, so much so that I wanted to make it my
career. However, after graduating and working in a lab for UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center), I felt...stuck. The work wasn't enjoyable to me after graduating and I looked for other career opportunities. I had taken 2 computer programming courses in high school, where we worked with Java, and even did some light coding in E-Prime and Python, 
using the PsychoPy library. While I did enojy doing this, I never went far enough to learn the intricies about the languages to understand what they were capable of. I decided to gave programming a try, and almost instantly fell in love with it. From building small projects like a Snake game in Python (ba dum tsss) using the Turtle library, to now trying
to build a website using HTML, CSS and JS. I'm hoping to build up a strong portfolio that will catch the eyes of employers so I can make the next step to starting a career in this field!
